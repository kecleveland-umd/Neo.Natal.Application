## Neo.Natal.Application
### Web application developed Tri-C Coding Bootcamp

This application was devevloped as part of the capstone project for my coding bootcamp. I worked in a small team to design a web application that used public demographic and geographical data to develop a profile for women who had recently given birth. Using the prototype from a medical hackathon project, Neo+Natal was designed for healthcare workers to create, store, and retrieve unique infant mortality risk profiles for their clients, in the hopes of identifying and providing immediate care for those highest at risk. 

The application consists of three major parts: 

* The front-end UI, written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* The back-end, using ASP.NET (the part I was mostly responsible for) 
* The database, using Microsoft SQL Server
